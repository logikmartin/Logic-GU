  <h1 class="page-title">Nordic Online Logic Seminars</h1>
  <p>The Nordic Online Logic Seminar (NOL Seminar) is organised monthly over Zoom, with expository talks on topics of interest for the broader logic community.
The seminar is open for professional or aspiring logicians and logic aficionados worldwide.</p>

<p>The tentative time slot is Monday, 16.00-17.30 (Gothenburg). See the announcement for the next talk below.
If you wish to receive the Zoom ID and password for it, as well as further announcements, <a href="https://listserv.gu.se/sympa/subscribe/nordiclogic">please subscribe here</a>.</p>

  <div class="seminar-lead"><span class="seminar-speaker">Wilfrid Hodges</span> (<span class="seminar-affil">Fellow of the British Academy</span>) – <span class="seminar-title">How the teenage Avicenna planned out several new logics</span>
  <div class="seminar-date">Monday, 24 May 2021 at 16:00 (CEST)</div></div>
  <div class="abstract"><p>Almost exactly a thousand years ago a teenager known today as Avicenna lived in what is now Uzbekistan.
He made a resolution to teach himself Aristotelian logic, armed with an Arabic translation of Aristotle and a century-old Arabic textbook of logic.
A couple of years later, around his eighteenth birthday, he wrote a brief report of what he had learned.
<!--more-->
Six months ago I started to examine this report - I suspect I am the first logician to do that.
It contains many surprising things.
Besides introducing some new ideas that readers of Avicenna know from his later works, it also identifies some specific points of modal logic where Avicenna was sure that Aristotle had made a mistake.
People had criticised Aristotle’s logic before, but not at these points.
At first Avicenna had no clear understanding of how to do modal logic, and it took him another thirty years to justify all the criticisms of Aristotle in his report.
But meanwhile he discovered for himself how to defend a new logic by building new foundations.
I think the logic itself is interesting, but the talk will concentrate on another aspect.
These recent discoveries mean that Avicenna is the earliest known logician who creates new logics and tells us what he is doing, and why, at each stage along the way.</p>

  <div class="seminar-lead"><span class="seminar-speaker">Jouko Väänänen</span> (<span class="seminar-affil">Helsinki</span>) – <span class="seminar-title">Dependence logic: Some recent developments</span>
  <div class="seminar-date">Monday, 26 April 2021 at 16:00 (CEST)</div></div>
  <div class="abstract"><p>In the traditional so-called Tarski’s Truth Definition the semantics of first order logic is defined with respect to an assignment of values to the free variables.
A richer family of semantic concepts can be modelled if semantics is defined with respect to a set (a “team”) of such assignments.
This is called team semantics.
<!--more-->
Examples of semantic concepts available in team semantics but not in traditional Tarskian semantics are the concepts of dependence and independence.
Dependence logic is an extension of first-order logic based on team semantics.
It has emerged that teams appear naturally in several areas of sciences and humanities, which has made it possible to apply dependence logic and its variants to these areas.
In my talk I will give a quick introduction to the basic ideas of team semantics and dependence logic as well as an overview of some new developments, such as quantitative analysis of team properties, a framework for a multiverse approach to set theory, and probabilistic independence logic inspired by the foundations of quantum mechanics.</p>

  <div class="seminar-lead"><span class="seminar-speaker">Dag Prawitz</span> (<span class="seminar-affil">Stockholm</span>) – <span class="seminar-title">Validity of inference and argument</span>
  <div class="seminar-date">Monday, 22 March 2021 at 16:00 (CET)</div></div>
  <div class="abstract"><p>An account of inferences should take into account not only inferences from established premisses but also inferences made under assumptions.
This makes it necessary to consider arguments, chains of inferences in which assumptions and variables may become bound.
<!--more-->
An argument is valid when all its inferences are valid, and it then amounts to a proof in case it has no unbound assumptions or variables.
The validity of an inference – not to confuse with the conclusion being a logical consequence of the premisses – seems in turn best explained in terms of proofs.
This means that the concepts of valid inference and valid argument depend on each other and cannot be defined independently but have to be described by principles that state how they are related.
A number of such principles will be proposed.
It is conjectured that inferences that can be expressed in the language of first order intuitionistic predicate logic and are implied to be valid by these principles are all provable in that logic.</p>
