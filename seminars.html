<p>Broader questions motivating this study are, among others: is natural (mathematical) language autonomous with respect to formal languages? Does a given semantically presented mathematical concept always have an implicit logic attached to it? What is the semantic point of view and how is it implemented in foundational practice?</p>

  <div class="seminar-date">Monday, 24 May 2021 at 16:00 (CEST)</div></div>
  <div class="abstract"><p>Almost exactly a thousand years ago a teenager known today as Avicenna lived in what is now Uzbekistan.
He made a resolution to teach himself Aristotelian logic, armed with an Arabic translation of Aristotle and a century-old Arabic textbook of logic.
A couple of years later, around his eighteenth birthday, he wrote a brief report of what he had learned.
<!--more-->
Six months ago I started to examine this report - I suspect I am the first logician to do that.
It contains many surprising things.
Besides introducing some new ideas that readers of Avicenna know from his later works, it also identifies some specific points of modal logic where Avicenna was sure that Aristotle had made a mistake.
People had criticised Aristotle’s logic before, but not at these points.
At first Avicenna had no clear understanding of how to do modal logic, and it took him another thirty years to justify all the criticisms of Aristotle in his report.
But meanwhile he discovered for himself how to defend a new logic by building new foundations.
I think the logic itself is interesting, but the talk will concentrate on another aspect.
These recent discoveries mean that Avicenna is the earliest known logician who creates new logics and tells us what he is doing, and why, at each stage along the way.</p>

  <div class="seminar-date">Friday, 21 May 2021 at 10:15 (CEST)</div></div>
  <div class="abstract"><p>I will present work in progress (together with Graham Leigh) on a novel proof of the conservativity of the intuitionistic fix-point theory over Heyting arithmetic (HA), originally proved in full generality by Arai [1].
<!--more-->
We make use of the work of van den Berg and van Slooten [2] on realizability in Heyting arithmetic over Beeson’s logic of partial terms (HAP).
Let IF be the extension of Heyting arithmetic by fix-points, denoted \hat{ID}<sup>i</sup><sub>1</sub> in the literature.
The proof is divided into four parts:
First we extend the inclusion of HA into HAP to IF into a similar theory IFP in the logic of partial terms.
We then show that every theorem of this theory provably has a realizer in the theory IFP(Λ) of fix-points for almost negative operator forms only.
Constructing a hierarchy stratifying the class of almost negative formulae and partial truth predicates for this hierarchy, we use Gödel’s diagonal lemma to show IFP(Λ) is interpretable in HAP.
Finally we use use the result of [2] that adding the schema of “self-realizability” for arithmetic formulae to HAP is conservative over HA.
The result generalises the work presented at my half-time seminar 2020-08-28.</p>

  <div class="seminar-lead"><span class="seminar-speaker">Sonia Marin</span> (<span class="seminar-affil">UCL</span>) – <span class="seminar-title">Focused nested calculi for modal and substructural logics</span>
  <div class="seminar-date">Friday, 07 May 2021 at 10:15 (CEST)</div></div>
  <div class="abstract"><p>Focusing is a general technique for syntactically compartmentalising the non-deterministic choices in a proof system, which not only improves proof search but also has the representational benefit of distilling sequent proofs into synthetic normal forms.
<!--more-->
However, since focusing was traditionally specified as a restriction of the sequent calculus, the technique had not been transferred to logics that lack a (shallow) sequent presentation, as is the case for some modal or substructural logics.</p>

<p>With K. Chaudhuri and L. Straßburger, we extended the focusing technique to nested sequents, a generalisation of ordinary sequents, which allows us to capture all the logics of the classical and intuitionistic S5 cube in a modular fashion. This relied on an adequate polarisation of the syntax and an internal cut-elimination procedure for the focused system which in turn is used to show its completeness.</p>

<p>Recently, with A. Gheorghiu, we applied a similar method to the logic of Bunched Implications (BI), a substructural logic that freely combines intuitionistic logic and multiplicative linear logic. For this we had first to reformulate the traditional bunched calculus for BI using nested sequents, followed again by a polarised and focused variant that we show is sound and complete via a cut-elimination argument.</p>

  <div class="seminar-lead"><span class="seminar-speaker">Jouko Väänänen</span> (<span class="seminar-affil">Helsinki</span>) – <span class="seminar-title">Dependence logic: Some recent developments</span>
  <div class="seminar-date">Monday, 26 April 2021 at 16:00 (CEST)</div></div>
  <div class="abstract"><p>In the traditional so-called Tarski’s Truth Definition the semantics of first order logic is defined with respect to an assignment of values to the free variables.
A richer family of semantic concepts can be modelled if semantics is defined with respect to a set (a “team”) of such assignments.
This is called team semantics.
<!--more-->
Examples of semantic concepts available in team semantics but not in traditional Tarskian semantics are the concepts of dependence and independence.
Dependence logic is an extension of first-order logic based on team semantics.
It has emerged that teams appear naturally in several areas of sciences and humanities, which has made it possible to apply dependence logic and its variants to these areas.
In my talk I will give a quick introduction to the basic ideas of team semantics and dependence logic as well as an overview of some new developments, such as quantitative analysis of team properties, a framework for a multiverse approach to set theory, and probabilistic independence logic inspired by the foundations of quantum mechanics.</p>

  <div class="seminar-lead"><span class="seminar-speaker">Carlo Nicolai</span> (<span class="seminar-affil">King's College</span>) – <span class="seminar-title">A New Look at Cut Elimination for Compositional Truth</span>
  <div class="seminar-date">Friday, 26 March 2021 at 10:15 (CET)</div></div>
  <div class="abstract"><p>In the field of axiomatic theories of truth, conservativity properties of theories are much investigated.
Conservativity can be used to argue that, despite the well-known undefinability of truth, there is a sense in which a primitive truth predicate can be reduced to the resources of an underlying mathematical theory that provides basic syntactic structure to truth ascriptions.
<!--more-->
Conservativity is typically proved model-theoretically, or proof-theoretically via the elimination of cuts on formulae containing truth (Tr-cuts). 
The original Tr-cut-elimination argument for the theory of Tarskian, compositional truth CT[B] by Halbach is not conclusive. 
This strategy has been corrected by Graham Leigh: Leigh supplemented Halbach’s strategy with the machinery of approximations (introduced by Kotlarski, Krajewski and Lachlan in the context of their M-Logic). 
In the talk we investigate a different, and arguably simpler way of supplementing Halbach’s original strategy. 
It is based on an adaptation of the Takeuti/Buss free-cut elimination strategy for first-order logic to the richer truth-theoretic context. 
If successful, the strategy promises to generalize to the type-free setting in a straightforward way. 
This is joint work with Luca Castaldo.</p>

  <div class="seminar-lead"><span class="seminar-speaker">Dag Prawitz</span> (<span class="seminar-affil">Stockholm</span>) – <span class="seminar-title">Validity of inference and argument</span>
  <div class="seminar-date">Monday, 22 March 2021 at 16:00 (CET)</div></div>
  <div class="abstract"><p>An account of inferences should take into account not only inferences from established premisses but also inferences made under assumptions.
This makes it necessary to consider arguments, chains of inferences in which assumptions and variables may become bound.
<!--more-->
An argument is valid when all its inferences are valid, and it then amounts to a proof in case it has no unbound assumptions or variables.
The validity of an inference – not to confuse with the conclusion being a logical consequence of the premisses – seems in turn best explained in terms of proofs.
This means that the concepts of valid inference and valid argument depend on each other and cannot be defined independently but have to be described by principles that state how they are related.
A number of such principles will be proposed.
It is conjectured that inferences that can be expressed in the language of first order intuitionistic predicate logic and are implied to be valid by these principles are all provable in that logic.</p>

  <div class="seminar-lead"><span class="seminar-speaker">Lance Rips</span> (<span class="seminar-affil">Northwestern University</span>) – <span class="seminar-title">Experimenting with (Conditional) Perfection</span>
  <div class="seminar-date">Friday, 12 March 2021 at 16:15 (CET)</div></div>
  <div class="abstract"><p>Conditional perfection is the phenomenon in which conditionals are strengthened to biconditionals.
In some contexts, “If A, B” is understood as if it meant “A if and only if B.” I’ll present and discuss a series of experiments designed to test one of the most promising pragmatic accounts of conditional perfection.
<!--more-->
This is the idea that conditional perfection is a form of exhaustification, triggered by a question that the conditional answers.
If a speaker is asked how B comes about, then the answer “If A, B” is interpreted exhaustively to meaning that A is the only way to bring about B.
Hence, “A if and only if B.” The evidence suggests that conditional perfection is a form of exhaustification, but not that it is triggered by a relationship to a salient question.

  <div class="seminar-date">Friday, 12 February 2021 at 10:15 (CET)</div></div>
  <div class="abstract"><p>A cyclic proof is a, possibly infinite but, regular derivation tree in which every infinite path satisfies a certain soundness criterion, the form of which depends on the logic under study. 
Circular and, more generally, non-wellfounded derivations are not traditionally regarded as formal proofs but merely as an intermediate machinery in proof-theoretic investigations.
<!--more-->
They are, however, an important alternative to finitary proofs and in the last decade have helped break some important barriers in the proof theory of logics formalising inductive and co-inductive concepts.
In this talk we focus on cyclic proofs for modal logics, ranging from Gödel-Löb logic to more expressive languages such as the modal mu-calculus, and reflect on how they can contribute to the development of the theory of fixed point modal logic.</p>

<div class="seminar" id="rasmus-blanck-interpretability-and-flexible-formulas">
  <div class="seminar-lead"><span class="seminar-speaker">Rasmus Blanck</span> (<span class="seminar-affil">FLoV</span>) – <span class="seminar-title">Interpretability and flexible formulas</span>
  <div class="seminar-date">Friday, 18 December 2020 at 10:15 (CET)</div></div>
  <div class="abstract"><p>This talk is about two different generalisations of Gödel’s incompleteness theorems and the (natural?) idea of trying to merge the two into a stronger result.
The first generalisation I have in mind is Feferman’s theorem on the “interpretability of inconsistency”.
This result strengthens the second incompleteness theorem, by showing that the sentence expressing that PA is inconsistent is not only consistent with PA, but even that PA + “PA is inconsistent” is interpretable in PA.
The second generalisation is due to Kripke, who showed that there is a flexible formula: a formula “whose extension as a set is left undetermined” by PA.
<!--more-->
In particular, he constructed a Σ-1 formula γ(x), such that for every Σ-1 formula σ(x), the theory PA + “γ = σ” is consistent.
This result generalises the first incompleteness theorem, since any instance of such a γ must be independent of PA.
Unfortunately, the straightforward combination of Feferman’s and Kripke’s theorems — the “interpretability of flexibility” — is a false claim.
Indeed, it is easy to show that there can be no Σ-1 formula γ such that for all Σ-1 formulae σ, the theory PA + “γ = σ” is interpretable in PA.</p>

<p>There are, however, several weaker results available, due to Enayat, Hamkins, Shavrukov, Woodin, and me.
These results either (1) relax the restriction on γ, (2) further restrict the allowed choices of σ’s, (3) strengthen the interpreting theory beyond PA, or (4) use equality modulo finite differences.
I will present these four intermediate results, along with the remaining question that they all fail to answer.
Finally, I will discuss why the known proof method does not seem to lend itself to giving a positive answer to this remaining question, as well as explain how any counterexample would have to look.</p>

  <div class="seminar-date">Friday, 20 November 2020 at 10:15 (CET)</div></div>
  <div class="abstract"><p>As anyone who reads the literature on bi-intuitionistic logic will know, the numerous papers by Cecylia Rauszer are foundational but confusing.
For example: these papers claim and retract various versions of the deduction theorem for bi-intuitionistic logic; they erroneously claim that the calculus is complete with respect to rooted canonical models; and they erroneously claim the admissibility of cut in her sequent calculus for this logic.
Worse, authors such as Crolard, have based some of their own foundational work on these confused and confusing results and proofs.
We trace this confusion to the axiomatic formalism of RBiInt in which Rauszer first characterized bi-intuitionistic logic and show that, as in modal logic, RBiInt can be interpreted as two different consequence relations.
We remove this ambiguity by using generalized Hilbert calculi, which are tailored to capture consequence relations.
We show that RBiInt leads to two logics, wBIL and sBIL, with different extensional and meta-level properties, and that they are, respectively, sound and strongly complete with respect to the Kripkean local and global semantic consequence relations of bi-intuitionistic logic.
Finally, we explain where they were conflated by Rauszer.</p>

  <div class="seminar-date">Friday, 09 October 2020 at 10:15 (CEST)</div></div>
  <div class="abstract"><p>An important fact about type theory, and something which is also heavily exploited in implementations, is that type checking is decidable
However, from a complexity-theoretic point of view the worst case upper bounds are quite serious: according to a result by Statman from 1979, the problem is not elementary recursive.
Recently, in the context of homotopy type theory people have started to consider a version of type theory in which all computation rules are replaced by propositional equalities.
In this talk, I will discuss this version of type theory, which one could call “objective type theory”.
In particular, I will show that if one formulates this objective type theory with sufficient care, type checking can be done in quadratic time.

  <div class="seminar-date">Friday, 25 September 2020 at 10:15 (CEST)</div></div>
  <div class="abstract"><p>The talk will be devoted to the formal connections between two canonical types of axiomatizations for the truth predicate: the disquotational scheme and the compositional clauses.
We will be interested in measuring the “logical distance” between the two canonical sets of principles and determining whether each of them “determine” the other.
Working in the framework of axiomatic truth theories we shall consider various ways of formalizing the above two questions and present the current state of art.
The talk initializes the project (under the same name) which started in Warsaw at the beginning of September.
At the current time there are still much more questions than answers, but we believe that it is worth uncovering this research perspective.
Some questions will be investigated jointly with the Gothenburg logic group.</p>

  <div class="abstract"><p>We develop an untyped semantic framework for the multiverse of set theory and show that its proof-theoretic commitments are mild. ZF is extended with semantical axioms utilizing the new symbols M(U) and M(U,σ), expressing that U is a universe and that σ is true in the universe U, respectively. Here σ ranges over the augmented language, leading to liar-style phenomena that are analysed. The framework is both compatible with a broad range of multiverse conceptions and suggests its own philosophically and semantically motivated multiverse principles.</p>

  <div class="abstract"><p>Dependence logic, proposed by Väänänen, is an elegant way of introducing dependencies between variables into the object language.
The framework of Dependence logic, so-called team semantics, has turned out to be very flexible and allows for interesting generalizations.
Instead of considering satisfaction with respect to a single assignment s, team semantics considers sets of assignments X, called teams.
While the semantics of Dependence logic is based on the principle that a formula φ is satisfied by a team X if every assignment s ∈ X satisfies φ, we will replace this principle by the following: a formula φ is satisfied by a team X if for every assignment s: s ∈ X iff s satisfies φ, replacing an implication by an equivalence.
When only first-order logic is considered nothing exciting happens, it is only when we introduce new logical operations that things start to get more exciting.</p>
